# Species interaction models with Stan (and R)
This collection contains code for fitting common species interaction models using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in Stan. We've prepared this as a living learning repository--these implementations are certain to be prone to errors, inefficiencies, and other ways of breaking down. Use at your own risk.

We welcome all contributions: errors spotted, new models, feature requests, etc.
